# Assignment day -4:
#
# Calculate discounted amount. Get the amount input from user. (float type)
#
# Amount <=1000, then 10% discount.
#
# 1000 < amount <=5000, then 20% discount
#
# 5000<amount <=10000, then 30% discount
#
# 10000<amount, then 40% discount.
#
# You need to print output in the below format.
#
# For e.g. if input is 5000.00
#
# Total Amount is 5000.00 dollars, discount is 1000.00 dollars, net amount is 4000.00 dollars
